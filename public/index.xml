    <description><![CDATA[What is String Template? String Template is a process of substituting values of variables into placeholders in a string. In the past, we relied on string concatenation to format output for print statements. System.out.println(arr[i] + &quot; &quot; + &quot;From for loop&quot;);

    <description><![CDATA[Hey there! We&rsquo;re going to work on a challenge together where we&rsquo;ll be writing a program called invest.py. The goal of this program is to track the growing amount of an investment over time.

For instance, if we start with a principal amount of $100 and an annual rate of return of 5%, the first year&rsquo;s increase will be $5.]]></description>
